  <p>SCRAMBLED words edition. </p>
  
  <p>
    In this game, all players get the same random set of letters.  They then drag and drop the letters to build a word.
    <br /> If the word is a valid dictionary word (text wordlist of 100,000+ English Words), they get 3 points for each letter in the word.
    <br /> Words already found using the current scrambled letters don't count.
    <br /> Each time a word is found, the player name and his/her score is shown.
    <br /> A high score is kept for the highest score in current live game.
    <br /> Uses the graphics handling library PIXI js.
    <br /> Uses the sound library ion sound.
    <br /> Uses Node.js and Socket.io for multiplayer capability in client/server framework.

  <p>COMMENTS: <br />I did not get to play this game in multi-player mode but I can see that it would be fun that way. Here is a way to play the game asynchronously
    <br /> - When a player goes in, let them play - and record words and time words were made (done)
    <br /> - Another player comes in and plays - but computer plays the recorded game (remember you only need words and time) or player 1. (done)
    <br /> - Have the computer show what Player 1 is doing (recorded game play) while you try to beat them (done)
    <br /> - Give option of playing random player or high score. (done)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    - BUG FIX: WEB-gl not supported, fall-back to canvas renderer (done)
    <br /> - PROGRESS: Game theory- find a 3 letter word for power up #1 (done)
    <br /> - PROGRESS: Game theory- find a 4+ letter word for power up #2 (done)
    <br />
